# bookOrix
The project entitled as “bookOrix – e-commerce Website” was to create a responsive website for selling & buying books and to develop community for book readers. This project has been developed on REACT (Front-End) and NODE.js with MongoDB (Back-End). This was done in order to get better understanding of the skills that are needed in the area of website design and development through MERN Stack development. There were many things that were taken in order to submit a successful project such as Market Research, identifying audience with their interest etc. This project made with REACT and NODE.js, so it’s a dynamic website and perform different types of dynamic database operations. Single-Page-Application approach as Server sends only one HTML page therefore REACT takes over and controls the UI. We just used JavaScript through React.js to change what's visible on the screen. And that often leads to a smoother UI and a better user experience. This project deals with the user side as well as server side the main goal of this website is to extend the customer satisfaction by catering easy user-friendly interface and “Our Mission is to Provide A Place To Feel Good, Whenever A Reader Visits”.
